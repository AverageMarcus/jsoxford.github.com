## Make the most of summer with a series of hands-on days.

With the long, warm evenings of summer we're taking a break from our evening meetups to have a hands-on summer of hacks.

TODO! Add a summary here.

Space is limited so grab your (free) tickets here:

<a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/jsoxford-coderetreat" class="btn btn-primary">Node School</a> | <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/jsoxford-coderetreat" class="btn btn-primary">Code Retreat</a> | <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/jsoxford-coderetreat" class="btn btn-primary">NodeBots</a>

All we ask is that if you can't make it you update your RSVP so we can give that space to someone else.

__We're holding all three events at [the Jam Factory](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview?ie=UTF-8&fb=1&gl=uk&q=The+Jam+Factory&cid=2949126679461980301&ei=sFqTU7jTFM3TOe_SgagJ&ved=0CJIBEPwSMA0).__

### Code Retreat - 5th July 2014 <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/jsoxford-coderetreat" class="btn btn-primary">Attend on Lanyrd</a>

<p class="lead">Write better code to a backdrop of pastries and burritos&hellip; the Code Retreat is a chance to hone your programming skills without the pressure of Getting Things Done.</p>

Following on from the success of the JavaScript Code Retreat in May we're excited to be running the 2nd Oxford Code Retreat, and this time it's Super-Mega! Want to get hone your JavaScript, Ruby or Python? Code Retreat is for you! This time we're shifting the focus from TDD to functional and object-oriented techniques.

#### What is it?
Code Retreat is a day of pair-programming around a common challenge. Over five 45-minute sessions you'll get to work with a variety of people to improve your day-to-day coding. At the end of each session we'll regroup and share what we've learned.

For a nice introduction to code retreat and why it's a great idea, [check out this video](http://player.vimeo.com/video/18955165?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0).

__We'll provide drinks and lunch!__

If you've got suggestions for a session or focus, please get in touch with us on Twitter (@jsoxford).

#### I'm in, where do I go?

We'll be meeting at [the Jam Factory](http://www.thejamfactoryoxford.com/) at 9am. After a healthy dose of coffee, pastries and introductions we'll crack into the first session at around 9:30 and finish for 6:30 before heading to the pub for one last 'retrospective'.

### NodeBots - 9th August 2014 <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/jsoxford-coderetreat" class="btn btn-primary">Attend on Lanyrd</a>

NodeBots are robots that are controlled by node.js. You don't get much cooler than that. Armed with soldering irons and parts we'll be teaming up in groups of 3 and creating some awe-inspiring Arduino-powered robots.

If you have no idea what an LED is or a resistor for that matter, have no fear - NodeBot experts will be readily available to help you hardware hack, solder, and 3D print your way to a full fledged NodeBot.

## How much does it cost?

Tickets are &pound;5.  You'll get this more than this back in food and drink alone - this is just to make sure that you really want to come.

## What do I need to bring?

If you've got a laptop with a development environment set up then all the better. Other than that all you need is yourself and a good collection of whoops and cheers!
