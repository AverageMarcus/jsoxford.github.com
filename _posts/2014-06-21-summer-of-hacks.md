# Join us for a series of hands-on events this summer

<p class="lead">We're taking a break from our evening meetups for the summer months.  Instead, we're going to hold hack days, where you can come along to learn, tinker, hack &amp; hang out with like minded people.</p>

TODO! Add a summary here.

Space is limited so grab your (free) tickets here:

All we ask is that if you can't make it you update your RSVP so we can give that space to someone else.

__We're holding all three events at [the Jam Factory](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview?ie=UTF-8&fb=1&gl=uk&q=The+Jam+Factory&cid=2949126679461980301&ei=sFqTU7jTFM3TOe_SgagJ&ved=0CJIBEPwSMA0).__

# NodeSchool <small>21st June 2014</small>

[NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/) is a free, community driven, open source educational project that teaches JavaScript and node.js skills in an interactive, self-guided way.

Register and attend if you want to meet up at the Jam Factory and dive into a nodeschool workshop. There are workshops available for every skill level from JS beginners all the way to experienced node programmers.

You will need to bring your own laptop, and it will help if you have already installed node.js (http://nodejs.org/). Mentors will help you on the day.

# Code Retreat <small>5th July 2014</small>

<p class="lead">Write better code to a backdrop of pastries and burritos&hellip; the Code Retreat is a chance to hone your programming skills without the pressure of Getting Things Done.</p>

Following on from the success of the JavaScript Code Retreat in May we're excited to be running the 2nd Oxford Code Retreat, and this time it's Super-Mega! Want to get hone your JavaScript, Ruby or Python? Code Retreat is for you! This time we're shifting the focus from TDD to functional and object-oriented techniques.

#### What is it?
Code Retreat is a day of pair-programming around a common challenge. Over five 45-minute sessions you'll get to work with a variety of people to improve your day-to-day coding. At the end of each session we'll regroup and share what we've learned.

For a nice introduction to code retreat and why it's a great idea, [check out this video](http://player.vimeo.com/video/18955165?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0).

__We'll provide drinks and lunch!__

If you've got suggestions for a session or focus, please get in touch with us on Twitter (@jsoxford).

#### I'm in, where do I go?

We'll be meeting at [the Jam Factory](http://www.thejamfactoryoxford.com/) at 9am. After a healthy dose of coffee, pastries and introductions we'll crack into the first session at around 9:30 and finish for 6:30 before heading to the pub for one last 'retrospective'.

# NodeBots <small>9th August 2014</small>

NodeBots are robots that are controlled by node.js. You don't get much cooler than that. Armed with soldering irons and parts we'll be teaming up in groups of 3 and creating some awe-inspiring Arduino-powered robots.

If you have no idea what an LED is or a resistor for that matter, have no fear - NodeBot experts will be readily available to help you hardware hack, solder, and 3D print your way to a full fledged NodeBot.

## How much does it cost?

Tickets are &pound;5.  You'll get this more than this back in food and drink alone - we're just making sure that you really want to come.

## What do I need to bring?

If you've got a laptop with a development environment set up then all the better. Other than that all you need is yourself and a good collection of whoops and cheers!
