<p class="lead">Write better code, eat better food&hellip; The JavaScript code retreat is a chance to hone your programming skills without the pressure of Getting Things Done.</p>

The [JS Code Retreat](http://jscoderetreat.com/2/) is a day of pair-programming around a common programming challenge. Over 5 to 6 45-minute programming sessions you'll get to work with a variety of people and work on improving your day-to-day coding, whether it's TDD, DRY, naming, or whatever. At the end of each session we'll regroup and share what we've learned. 

### What do I need to bring?

Just your good self and a laptop. If you've got a ready-to-go environment all the better, but if not we'd recommend [TDDBin](http://www.tddbin.com/).

We'll provide drinks and lunch!

### How much does it cost?

We take payment in fun, effort and brainpower. There is no entry fee, you just need to a [RSVP on Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2014/jsoxford-coderetreat/attendees/).

### Where?

We'll be meeting at [White October](http://www.whiteoctober.co.uk/) to kick off at 8.30AM. Although that's pretty early for a Saturday, we're sychronising with groups from Cologne, Munich and Barcelona (so far). The upside is that it's early enough for pastries!

All we ask is that if you can't make it you <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/jsoxford-coderetreat/attendees/">update your RSVP</a> so we can get that space to someone else.

### That sounds great, how can I help?

At the moment we'd be really grateful for:

* **Sponsorship!** Help us provide codefuel to keep the creative juices flowing. 
* **Help on the day.** There's plenty of setting up and clearing down, as well as keeping the day running smoothly. Get in touch if you're keen to help out.
* **Spread the word.** Most important of all, shout it from the rooftops (or just use Twitter&hellip;).
