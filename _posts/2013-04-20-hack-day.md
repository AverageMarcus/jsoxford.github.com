We're organising a hack day as a fringe event around the [jQuery UK](http://events.jquery.org/2013/uk) conference.  We'll be driving RC cars around with a node.js library.

The day is sold out at the moment,  though if we get more cars sponsored - we can open up places.  Please get in contact if you are interested in sponsoring a car.

More details are on the [event page](http://events.jquery.org/2013/uk/extras.html) and on [lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2013/jsoxford-hackday/).
