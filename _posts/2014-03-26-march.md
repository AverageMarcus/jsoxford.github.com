### And we're back! &hellip;on a TUESDAY!?!

<p class="lead">This month we're talking about getting our code running in the real world. Come along to find out how to deploy apps with <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">heroku</a> and how continuous deployment can help you build software faster and with less stress.</p>

> Can you build and deploy a site in 5 minutes from scratch?
> This will be a live code session where I try to do node and heroku at speed, and explain it at the same time.
> May well be a codetastrophe, heckling encouraged!
