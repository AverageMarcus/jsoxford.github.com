<p class="lead">Join us for the last meetup of 2013 where we'll be talking about using streams in node and chattting about some new JS Projects</p>

## Indestructible twitter streams with node
### by [Ben](http://benjaminbenben.com) <small><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=benjaminbenben">@benjaminbenben</a></small>

> The twitter streaming apis are totally fun and super awesome.
> 
> I'll cover the (surprisingly detailed) data that we can get from the streams, and some of the challenges that we have to face to maintain a connection.
> 
> We'll delve into the node stream API - and how we can use this to abstract a robust interface to the twitter apis that can survive network failures, stale connections and modifying query parameters.
> 
> Then we'll talk about some of the awesome projects/hacks that we can do when we are able to dynamically alter parameters.

## Bring yOur Own hYperlink Along - BOOYA
### by Everyone!

We're going to try a new type of session, bring a few links to js-based projects that you find interesting and we'll go through them and have a quick chat.

It doesn't matter if you don't know anything about the project, just anything that you find interesting or cool!

Please add links beforehand by commenting on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/benfoxall/7908946)
